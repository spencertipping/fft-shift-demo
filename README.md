# FFT phase correlation example
Based on [this FFT code](https://github.com/turbomaze/JS-Fourier-Image-Analysis).

This is a really simple demo to help me figure out how phase correlation
worked. To run:

```sh
$ git submodule update
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Then browse to localhost:8080. The phase correlation output is calculated in
realtime as you drag/resize the image.
